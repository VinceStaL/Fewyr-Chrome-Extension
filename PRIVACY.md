# Fewyr Privacy Policy

## Single Purpose Description
Fewyr is designed with a single, focused purpose: to help users create and manage meeting agendas directly in their browser. The extension streamlines the process of creating structured meeting agendas to promote more efficient and focused meetings.

## Permission Justification

### clipboardWrite
- **What it does:** Allows the extension to copy meeting agenda text to the system clipboard
- **Why we need it:** This permission is essential for the core functionality of copying the formatted meeting agenda to share with others
- **How it's used:** Only activated when users explicitly click the "Copy" or "Copy Agenda" buttons

## Data Collection and Storage

### Local Storage
- All meeting data is stored locally in your browser
- No data is transmitted to external servers
- No personal information is collected or shared

## Data Security
- All agenda creation and management happens entirely within your browser
- No authentication or user accounts required
- No external API calls or data transmission

## Updates and Changes
We reserve the right to update this privacy policy as needed. Any changes will be reflected in the extension's Chrome Web Store listing and documentation.
